# SwimMeetScore To-Do List

## UI Improvements
- [ ] Put diving where it should go in the event order instead of at the top of the list
- [ ] Remove "Individual swimming event" from "settings-> Add new events" footer
- [ ] Instead of having to click an edit and a save button in settings, allow clicking on the numbers directly to edit and hit enter to save
- [ ] Make the area where users enter the scores (dropdowns) less wide so they fit better on one row on a cellphone screen
- [ ] Make the X, to close the settings menu, always in the top right and make it red
- [ ] When you hit an X, prompt the user "Are you sure you want to delete this event?"
- [ ] When the settings button is clicked, the settings menu should open at the top, not in the middle of the page
- [ ] Put the "Add new event" button at the bottom

## Content & Copy
- [ ] Change everywhere it says "Tracker" to "Score" since the app name changed from Swim Meet Tracker to SwimMeetScore
- [ ] Add "Contact Us" links: info@swimmeetscore.com and support@swimmeetscore.com
- [ ] Add any relevant "Terms of Use", "Privacy Policy", or "Terms and Conditions" links or verbiage as recommended
- [ ] Add Copyright © 2026 Kaden Co - All rights reserved.

## Features & Functionality
- [ ] Make separate "clear all data and reset" buttons, where one button does not clear the templates
- [ ] Add a donate button so users can contribute via PayPal to help with hosting and development costs

## Setup / Deployment
- [ ] Setup a preview branch in Git so you can safely test new SwimMeetScore pages without breaking the live site
